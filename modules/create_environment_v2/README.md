# Module Cloud Composer Environment ([V2](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/composer-overview))

This optional module is used to create a Cloud Composer environment.

```hcl
module "composer" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/composer/google//modules/create_environment_v2"

  project = "project-123"
  name    = "Composer-Prod-Env"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```
