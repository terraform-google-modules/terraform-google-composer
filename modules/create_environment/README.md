# Module Cloud Composer Environment

This optional module is used to create a Cloud Composer environment.

```hcl
module "composer" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/composer/google//modules/create_environment"

  project = "project-123"
  name    = "Composer-Prod-Env"
  region  = "us-central1"

  config {
    node_count = "3"

    node_config {
      zone         = "us-central1-f"
      machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
      network    = "test-network"
      subnetwork = "test-subnetwork"
    }
  }
}
```
